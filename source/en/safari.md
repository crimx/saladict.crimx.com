# Safari

Saladict for Safari is still at an early stage. Please fire an [issue](https://github.com/crimx/ext-saladict/issues) if you encounter bugs or crashes.

Saladict is also looking for a volunteer who can help upload the app to App Store.

## Installation

1. Download and open the app.
2. Open Safari `Preferences` -> `Advanced` -> `Show Develop menu in menu bar`.
3. On Safari top menu bar, choose `Develop` -> `Allow unsigned extensions`.
4. Open `Safari Preferences` (Command+,) and choose the `Extensions` tab.
5. Tick the Saladict extension.
6. Go to any webpage. You should see the Saladict icon on the left of the address bar. Click and choose `Always allow on every website`.
7. Enjoy Saladict for Safari!
8. P.S. If you quit Safari (Command+Q), you have to enable `Allow unsigned extensions` again.
9. If the word panel appears blank, it may be due to a system language encoding issue. Open Safari settings, go to "Advanced", "Default Encoding", select UTF-8, then press command + q to quit Safari and reopen it.
