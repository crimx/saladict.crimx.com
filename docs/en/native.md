# Works Outside of Browser

Theoretically there are two ways to make Saladict work outside of browser:

- Search clipboard content with global shortcut(which is the theory behind all current toolchains).
- Native messaging via browser API(Not implemented. PRs are welcomed!).

## Search directly

Browser offers global shortcuts settings for extensions through which we can search text on any place.

1. Open `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`, set a `Global` shortcut for ***Search clipboard content in Standalone Panel***.
2. Copy any text, then press the shortkeys.

Many brilliant users on Saladict have found out ways to automate this process with other tools. Thank them for taking the time to share all these magnificent tutorials!
